        <h3> Asteroids</h3>
        
        <p>Type: S-type asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: 22 million km<br>
            Orbital Period: 643 days (~1.76 years)<br>
            Description: One of the largest near-Earth asteroids, Eros was the first<br>
            asteroid to be orbited and landed on by a spacecraft (NEAR Shoemaker in
            2001).<br>
            (101955) Bennu <br><br></p>

        <p>Type: B-type asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: ~300,000 km (within lunar distance)<br>
            Orbital Period: 436.6 days (~1.2 years)<br>
            Description: Bennu is famous for being the target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx <br>
            mission, which collected samples and returned them to Earth in 2023. Its <br>
            close approaches make it a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA).<br>
            (99942) Apophis<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Type: S-type asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: ~31,600 km (approaching Earth in 2029)<br>
            Orbital Period: 323 days (~0.88 years)<br>
            Description: Apophis is notable for its extremely close approach to Earth in <br>
            2029, within the distance of geostationary satellites. It was once thought <br>
            to pose a risk of collision with Earth.<br>
            (3122) Florence<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Type: S-type asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: 7 million km<br>
            Orbital Period: 859 days (~2.35 years)<br>
            Description: Florence is one of the largest known PHAs and safely passed <br>
            Earth in 2017. ItÕs notable for its size (~4.5 km in diameter) and close flyby.<br>
            (29075) 1950 DA<br><br>
            Type: C-type asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: ~8 million km<br>
            Orbital Period: 2.11 years<br>
            Description: 1950 DA is notable for its potential risk of collision in the <br>
            distant future (2880). Its near-Earth orbit makes it a key subject of study <br>
            for asteroid impact prediction.<br>
            (99907) 1989 VB<br><br>
            Type: Apollo group asteroid<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: ~1 million km<br>
            Orbital Period: 1.78 years<br>
            Description: This asteroid regularly passes near Earth, and its orbit <br>
            classifies it as an Apollo asteroid, meaning its orbit crosses Earth's orbit.<br><br>
            </p>
           <h3>Comets (Near-Earth Comets - NECs)<br></h3> 
           <p>
            Comet 103P/Hartley (Hartley 2)<br>
            Type: Jupiter-family comet<br>
            Closest Approach to Earth: 18 million km<br>
            Orbital Period: 6.47 years<br>
            Description: Hartley 2 is a small comet that made a close approach to Earth <br>
            in 2010. It was visited by NASA's EPOXI mission, revealing its <br>
            peanut-shaped nucleus.<br><br>
            Comet 1P/Halley (Halley's Comet)<br>
            Type: Short-period comet<br>
Closest Approach to Earth: 24 million km<br>
Orbital Period: 75.3 years<br>
Description: HalleyÕs Comet is one of the most famous comets, visible from <br>
Earth roughly every 75 years. Its next perihelion (closest approach to the <br>
Sun) will be in 2061. <br><br>
Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)<br>
Type: Short-period comet<br>
Closest Approach to Earth: 24 million km<br>
Orbital Period: 75.3 years<br>
Description: HalleyÕs Comet is one of the most famous comets, visible from<br>
Earth roughly every 75 years. Its next perihelion (closest approach to the<br>
Sun) will be in 2061.<br><br>
Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)<br>
Type: Short-period comet<br>
Closest Approach to Earth: 40 million km<br>
Orbital Period: 3.3 years<br>
Description: EnckeÕs Comet has the shortest orbital period of any known <br>
comet and is a frequent visitor to the inner solar system.<br><br>
Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp)<br>
Type: Long-period comet<br>
Closest Approach to Earth: 194 million km<br>
Orbital Period: ~2,533 years<br>
Description: Hale-Bopp was one of the brightest comets of the 20th <br>
century and was visible to the naked eye for over 18 months.<br><br>
</p>
<h3> Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)<br></h3>
<p>
PHAs are asteroids with orbits that bring them very close to Earth,<br>
typically within 7.5 million km, and have a size large enough (140 meters or 
more)<br>
 to cause significant damage in the event of an impact.<br><br>
</p>
<h4> Trojan asteroid<br></h4>
 <p>
Closest Approach to Earth: ~15 million km<br>
Orbital Period: 1.01 years<br>
Description: This asteroid is the first Earth Trojan, meaning it shares<br>
EarthÕs orbit but doesnÕt pose a collision threat. It stays ahead of Earth in 
its orbit.<br>
Integrating These Bodies into Your Orrery Web App:<br>
NASA NeoWs API: For real-time data on NEOs, use the NASA NeoWs API,<br>
which provides current positions and orbital elements.<br>
Orbital Paths: For each body, plot its orbital path using Keplerian elements <br>
(semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, etc.) that you can obtain from <br>
databases like JPL's Horizons system or the NeoWs API.<br>
Dynamic Updates: Fetch NEO data dynamically to keep the app updated with<br>
the latest near-Earth objects.<br>
By incorporating these near-Earth asteroids and comets into your web app, <br>
users will be able to explore the fascinating world of NEOs and their <br>
interactions with Earth in real time. Let me know if you'd like help setting <br>
up the backend API integration or visualization<br>
